# Netflix-clone

This repository contains the code for my Netflix Clone project, which I developed during my internship. The project aims to replicate the user interface of the popular streaming platform Netflix using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

# Technologies Used

- `HTML` for structuring the content.
- `CSS3` for styling and layout, including media queries for responsiveness.
- `JavaScript` for navigating the pages from login page to home page.
-  #GitHub for version control and collaboration & deploy using GitHub actions. 

# Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.

# Materials
Netflix logo and images are sourced from the official Netflix website.
