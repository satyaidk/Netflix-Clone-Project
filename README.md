# Netflix-clone

This repository contains the code for my Netflix Clone project, which I developed during my internship. The project aims to replicate the user interface of the popular streaming platform Netflix using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

# Technologies Used

- HTML for structuring the content.
- CSS3 for styling and layout, including media queries for responsiveness.
- JavaScript for implementing interactive features and fetching external data.
- GitHub for version control and collaboration & deploy using GitHub actions.
